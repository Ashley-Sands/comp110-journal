Most combinatorial algorithms involve the generative enumeration of one or all configurations satisfying certain requirements. A program for realizing a systematic search or enumeration frequently, and quite naturally, takes the form of a nest of iterations. A search logically so structured has been called backtrack by Professor D. H. Lehmer and backtrack programming by S.W. Golomb and L.D. Baumert. A backtrack algorithm incorporating well designed impasse detection is frequently the most direct and efficient approach to an enumerative calculation. This chapter discusses the concept of nested iteration and it is associated with-statement notation as a basis for a detailed discussion of backtrack programming, a fundamental tool of combinatorial computing. Backtrack programming is sometimes useful, or necessary, in certain problems of optimization, problems which involve search for an optimum member of a finite class of objects whose generation has an arborescent structure.},
